pydpflib - fast DPF access from Python
======================================

See dpflib_c.py as example how to use it and 
how you can display images on your DPF.

dpflib_py.py shows how you can access your DPF
without dpflib.a python bindings.

Installing pydpflib on GNU/Linux Systems
========================================

You will first need to install the following packages:

1) python (pydpflib is useless without it)
2) gcc (the compiler, linker, etc.)
3) python-dev (includes header files needed to compile pydpflib)
4) libusb-dev (C library to be linked)

sudo apt-get install python gcc python-dev libusb-dev

Once the above packages are installed, you can build and install pydpflib
with the command

make all
sudo make install
